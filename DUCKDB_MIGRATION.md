# DuckDB Migration Summary

## ✅ Successfully migrated from SQLite to DuckDB

### Changes Made:

1. **Cargo.toml**
   - Replaced `rusqlite` with `duckdb = { version = "1.0", features = ["bundled"] }`
   - Used bundled feature to avoid system dependency issues

2. **src/database.rs**
   - Changed imports from `rusqlite` to `duckdb`
   - Updated schema to use `DOUBLE[]` for embeddings (DuckDB's native array type)
   - Modified embedding storage to use JSON with CAST to DOUBLE[] for DuckDB compatibility

3. **src/error.rs**
   - Updated error handling from `rusqlite::Error` to `duckdb::Error`

4. **src/main.rs**
   - Updated help text to reference "DuckDB" instead of "SQLite"

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - README.md: Updated all references from SQLite to DuckDB
   - example_queries.sql: Updated header comment
   - run_example.sh: Updated file extension to .duckdb
   - test_setup.sh: Updated example command
   - PROJECT_SUMMARY.md: Updated implementation details
   - .gitignore: Updated to ignore .duckdb files

### Key Benefits of DuckDB:

- **Native Array Support**: DuckDB has built-in support for array types (`DOUBLE[]`)
- **Advanced Analytics**: Better suited for analytical workloads and vector operations  
- **Performance**: Optimized for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) queries
- **Future Extensions**: Better foundation for vector similarity operations

### Verified Working:

- ✅ Project compiles successfully with bundled DuckDB
- ✅ Database initialization works correctly
- ✅ Tables created with proper schema including DOUBLE[] arrays
- ✅ Embedding model validation works
- ✅ Command line interface updated
- ✅ All documentation updated

### File Extensions Changed:
- `.db` → `.duckdb`
- Database files now use DuckDB's native format

The migration is complete and the system is fully functional with DuckDB as requested!
