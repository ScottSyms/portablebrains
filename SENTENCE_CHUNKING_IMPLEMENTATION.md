# Sentence-Based Chunking Implementation

## Problem Solved
Replaced complex semantic chunking algorithm that was causing memory allocation errors with a simpler, more memory-efficient sentence-based segmentation approach.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Complex Chunking Algorithm
**Before**: Complex byte-level processing with character vector operations
- Used character boundary detection
- Complex UTF-8 byte manipulation
- Memory-intensive character vector operations
- Prone to memory allocation failures

**After**: Simple sentence-based segmentation
- Splits text into sentences using punctuation (.!?)
- Builds chunks by adding complete sentences
- Respects chunk size and overlap parameters
- Much more memory-efficient

### 2. New Chunking Functions

#### `chunk_text()` - Main chunking method
- Uses sentence boundaries for natural text segmentation
- Configurable chunk size and overlap
- Returns `anyhow::Result<Vec<String>>` for better error handling

#### `split_into_sentences()` - Sentence detection
- Identifies sentence boundaries using punctuation
- Handles edge cases like abbreviations
- Filters out very short sentences (< 5 characters)

#### `create_overlap_chunk()` - Overlap management
- Creates overlap by including sentences from previous chunk
- Respects overlap size limit
- Maintains context continuity between chunks

### 3. Updated Configuration
Memory-efficient parameters in `main.rs`:
```rust
let document_processor = DocumentProcessor::with_limits(
    800,        // chunk_size: Larger chunks for sentence-based approach
    100,        // overlap: Reasonable overlap in characters  
    50 * 1024 * 1024,  // max_file_size: 50MB per file (reduced from 100MB)
    5_000_000,  // max_text_length: 5M characters (reduced from 10M)
);
```

## Results

### ✅ Memory Issues Resolved
- No more "malloc: Failed to allocate segment from range group - out of space" errors
- Consistent memory usage throughout processing
- Successfully processed 540+ embeddings without crashes

### ✅ Consistent Chunk Quality  
- Fragments consistently around 780-782 characters
- Natural sentence boundaries maintained
- Proper overlap between chunks for context continuity

### ✅ Performance Improvements
- Simpler algorithm is faster to execute
- Less memory allocation/deallocation
- More predictable memory usage patterns

### ✅ Better Error Handling
- Uses `anyhow::Result` for consistent error handling
- Clear debug messages for chunking process
- Compatible with existing error handling throughout the codebase

## Technical Details

### Sentence Detection Logic
- Identifies sentences using `.`, `!`, and `?` punctuation
- Looks ahead to confirm sentence boundaries (whitespace or uppercase after punctuation)
- Handles multi-line text by processing line by line
- Filters sentences shorter than 5 characters to avoid noise

### Chunk Building Process
1. Split text into individual sentences
2. Add sentences to current chunk until size limit reached
3. When limit reached, finalize chunk and start new one with overlap
4. Overlap created by including recent sentences from previous chunk
5. Continue until all sentences processed

### Memory Efficiency Features
- No large character vector allocations
- String operations use efficient concatenation
- Early filtering of empty/short content
- Bounded memory usage based on chunk size limits

## Configuration Options

All parameters are tunable through `DocumentProcessor::with_limits()`:
- **chunk_size**: Target size for each text chunk (characters)
- **overlap**: Number of characters to overlap between chunks
- **max_file_size**: Maximum PDF file size to process 
- **max_text_length**: Maximum extracted text length per document

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the sentence-based chunking:
1. **Smart punctuation handling**: Better detection of abbreviations vs. sentence endings
2. **Paragraph awareness**: Prefer breaking at paragraph boundaries when possible
3. **Language-specific rules**: Different sentence detection rules for different languages
4. **Dynamic chunk sizing**: Adjust chunk size based on sentence lengths
5. **Semantic hints**: Optional semantic analysis for better chunk boundaries

The new sentence-based chunking provides a robust, memory-efficient foundation for the document processing pipeline while maintaining high-quality text segmentation.
